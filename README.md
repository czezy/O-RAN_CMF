# O-RAN_CMF
Conflict Mitigation Framework for O-RAN

**Simulation scenario**
1. base stations and simulation area:
    - 19 base stations (BS) distributed on a hexagonal grid
    - distance between each BS is equal to 600 meters
    - simulation area is limited with a polygonal shapre approximating coverage distance of the network
    - coverage provided by each BS is not split into sectors

2. users:
    - 380 randomly distributed across the simulation area
    -
